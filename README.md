# POINT2 Full-Range Speakers
Designed by Adam Anderson

## Design
The design combines laser cutting and 3D-printing to make a fairly simple speaker that also sounds (surprisingly) good. They use a 3.5" Dayton Audio DMA90 aluminum cone full range driver, which has a fairly linear response all the way through higher frequencies. The ported design also helps the speakers to dig a bit deeper into the bass range, to about 60Hz. The files can easily be changed to accomodate a different driver.

## Build

The following components are needed to build one speaker:

- ### Dayton Audio DMA90-4 driver
   Can be replaced with another driver, you can probably fit a 4" driver. 
    
- ### 3D printed supports and horn
  The files can be found in `Supports` folder. The parts with `Side` in the name needs to be printed mirrored as well. The speaker will maybe sound better (at least look better) if the horn is sanded smooth. 

- ### Plywood panels
  Dxf files for laser cutting can be found under `Panels`. I used 4mm plywood, remember to use longer screws if you decide to use thicker plywood. 

- ### Sealing tape
  This tape is used to create an airtight seal between all of the panels and to seal the horn. Low-end response is significantly worse if air can escape through somewhere other than the horn. I used 4mm wide tape. 

- ### M3x8 screws
  Probably the defining feature of the build. Too many to count, buy 100 and you will be safe. 

- ### M3x20 screws, M3 nuts
  8 each to mount the speaker and the horn.

- ### Speaker terminals and wires
  I bought banana plug jacks from ebay. You will have to add cutouts in the back panel.
